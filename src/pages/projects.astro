        description="I snagged a budget-friendly HP Elitedesk for just €110 with an i7 8700 processor and 16GB RAM, then upgraded it to 48GB RAM with a 2TB HDD and 500GB SSD. I've transformed it into a versatile homelab server running Proxmox and Docker, hosting multiple virtual machines and containers. My setup now runs several useful services including my personal website, Pi-hole for ad-blocking, a Wireguard VPN server for secure access, Immich for keeping my photos safely backed up, and TrueNAS for all my file storage needs."
